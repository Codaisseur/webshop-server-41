## Steps for building a backend

1. UML => datamodel
2. Generate models (careful with the logic order on relations);
3. Set up relations on migrations
4. Seed! test if this works.
5. Set up associations in the models
6. Queries! Try including stuff in my queries

Data layer done!!

Now weblayer

1. create index.js
2. start up simple express server
3. create a simple GET route
4. Test with httpie!

If everything is ok, our backend setup rocks! and we should have no problem with sequelize so
now its about building the routes we need.
